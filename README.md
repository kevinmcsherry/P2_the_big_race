# The Big Race!

The Big Race is a gaming website which offers the user an opportunity to play a race car game.  The instructions are simple, the user must pick a race winner with three cars to choose from.  Each time the user selects the correct car, they receive a point.  Each time a particular car wins, that colour of car receives a point.  If its a draw, no points are allocated.  The game continues until a car, the user or both get to 5 points.
The page is very clearly laid out with clear instructions to the user in order to carry out the game, and in order to complete the individual races and ultimately the game is really simple and requires only a mouse click by the user.
Its a fun game in which users of any age can enjoy and even compete among friends!
